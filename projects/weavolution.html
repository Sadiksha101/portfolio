    <h2>WEAVOLUTION</h2>
    <p>
      Weavolution was created for a client of <a
        href="https://alternative.com.np/"

        >Alternative Technology Pvt. Ltd.</a
      >
      and involved designing and developing a form for ordering a copy of the
      Weavolution book. After users filled out the form with their details, an
      email was automatically sent to the provided email address with order
      confirmation and other relevant information. I was responsible for both
      the UI/UX design and the development of this project, ensuring the form
      was user-friendly, functional, and visually appealing. The project
      streamlined the order process and provided users with a seamless
      experience from submission to receiving the confirmation email.
